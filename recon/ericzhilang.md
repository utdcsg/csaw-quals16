# Eric Zhi Liang

We tried very hard to find Eric last year. You're going to have to try just as hard this year, since not even his friends can find him.

We heard Eric has his own subreddit. Can you find Eric for us?

## Solution

- Googled “Eric Liang Reddit”
- Found [https://www.reddit.com/r/ericliang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ericliang/)
- theRealEricLiang was one of the moderators
- Looked through theRealEricLiang’s comments and posts
- Found a post by Eric mentioning he went to a Hackster Meetup in NYC
- Googled “Hackster Meetup in NYC”

- Found his profile info: “I love fanfiction and Allen Lau!”
- Googled Allen Lau
- Found that Allen Lau is the CEO and co-founder of something called Wattpad
